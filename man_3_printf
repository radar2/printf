SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"

int printf(const char *\fIformat\fB, ...);

DESCRIPTION
The function \fB_printf()\fR writes output to \fIstdout\fR, the standard 
output. The function writes under the control of a \fIformat\fR string that 
specifies how subsequent arguments (accessed via the variable-length argument 
facilities of stdarg) are converted for output.

Return value

Upon successful return,  returns the number of characters 
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, -1 is returned.


Format of the format string

The format string is a constant character string composed of zero or more 
directives: ordinary characters which are copied unchanged to 
the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in 
fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
